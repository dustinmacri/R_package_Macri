```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installation

Load in common libraries used by this package

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

You might need to install some genomics R packages for this package to run
```{r, eval= FALSE}
install.packages("vcfr")
```

Now, we install my R package:

```{r, eval= FALSE}
devtools::install_github("dustinmacri/R_package_Macri")
library(MacriRPAckage)
```

Let us download some data for our package:

```{r}
download.file()
```

## Working Example

+ An example of each function and how it works
+ Say something about why this is a good thing to do
+ Say something about about expected output

```{r}
result <- mult(4,5)
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
